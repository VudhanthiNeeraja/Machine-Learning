## COST FUNCTION:

Cost Function for the linear regression to minimize:

y^(i) is the ith training example of the profit.

hθ(x^(i)) is the models true estimate of the profit.

m is the length of the data.

Here x and y are not scalar variables but the matrices which have the population and the profit data.


Here hθ(x) is the hypothesis and given by the Linear model is:
